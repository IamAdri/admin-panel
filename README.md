# Admin Panel website

## Description
Admin panel website used to fetch and mutate data for Adrielle e-commerce website.

This project is a *demo* for my portofolio and it can do the following main tasks:

- **CRUD** actions of an admin website: fetch products and orders, edit and delete existing products, add new product. 
- Show **charts** regarding revenue of last 6 months and general customer`s ratings
- Authenticate administrator with **Supabase authenticator**.
- **Log out** user automatically at the end of session.
- -Change admin details and **password**.

## Notes
* As it is an admin panel website I implemented the functionality to allow acces only to **authenticated admin** and log him out automatically the session ends. Please see **credentials** required in **Getting Started** section.
* Text and images used in this project were created and generated by **ChatGPT** and **OpenArt**.

## Getting Started
In order to explore the website you need to use the following **credentials:**
* email (fake adress safe to use) - **admin@gmail.com**
* password - **AdminPanel1!**
  
If you want to test **adding new product** functionality, feel free to use **images as demo** from public/test folder.

## Reflection
I created this website as a second project for my portofolio. After creating a demo e-commerce websiste Adrielle, I thought it would be a good idea to create an admin panel so that I can implement more **CRUD actions** and also to show the ability to connect more than one websites to **same database** so that changes in one website would affect the second.

In order to diversify my portofolio and show my knowledge I have decided to create this one with **React** and **React Query** as for the first one I used Next.js. Also, for styling I used **styled-components** and for authentication the **Supabase Authenticator** with credentials. 

It was a great learning experience of using React Query and **React Hook Form** for data fetching and mutating. Also, it was an opportunity to create charts with **Recharts** library and getting used to search and implement external libraries in the project. Personally, it was challenging to think about all side affects that might happen in both projects by mutating data in admin panel and reflect **realtime changes** in adrielle website.
