# Admin Panel website

## Description
Admin panel website used to fetch and mutate data for Adrielle ecommerce website.

This project is an example for my portofolio and it can do the following main tasks:

- CRUD actions of an admin website: fetch products and orders, edit and delete existing products, add new product. 
- Show charts regarding revenue of last 6 months and general customer`s ratings
- Authenticate administrator with Supabase authenticator.

## Reflection
I created this website as a second project for my portofolio. After creating a fictional ecommerce websiste Adrielle, I thought it would be a good idea to create an admin panel so that I can implement more CRUD actions and also to show the ability to connect to websites to same database so that mutations in one website would affect the second.

In order to diversify my portofolio and show my knowledge I have decided to create this one with React and React Query as for the first one I used Next.js. Also, for styling I used Styled Components and for authentication the Supabase Authenticator with credentials. 

It was a great learning experience of using React Query and React Hook Form for fetching and mutating data. Also, it was an opportunity to create charts with Recharts library and getting used to search and implement external libraries in the project. Personally, it was challenging to think about all side affects that might happen in both projects by mutating data in admin panel and identify all conditions that should be implemented to avoid differences or errors.
